## What is StruxJS?

StruxJS is a modern, TypeScript-first web framework that combines the blazing-fast performance of **Fastify** with the elegant, developer-friendly Developer Experience (DX) of frameworks like Laravel. It provides a robust architecture out-of-the-box, allowing you to focus on building features rather than wrestling with configuration.

### Key Features

* **Blazing Fast HTTP:** Powered by Fastify under the hood for maximum throughput.
* **IoC Container:** A powerful Dependency Injection container that manages class dependencies automatically.
* **Active Record ORM:** An expressive `BaseModel` ORM inspired by Eloquent, supporting relationships, scopes, and aggregations.
* **Concurrency Engine:** Built-in Multi-Core Cluster Engine and `ThreadPool` for heavy CPU-bound tasks without blocking the event loop.
* **Authentication & Security:** Native support for CSRF protection, Rate Limiting (Throttle), Session Management, and JWT API Authentication.
* **Background Jobs:** A robust Redis-backed Queue system with asynchronous workers.
* **Event Broadcasting:** Built-in WebSocket broadcasting for real-time applications.
* **Expressive Routing:** Clean and fluent routing API (`Route.get(...)`) with middleware and route groups.
* **Vite Integration:** Seamless frontend asset bundling with Vite (`.strux` view engine included).

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update your database/redis credentials.

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *The server will start at `http://localhost:3000` (by default).*

4. **Start the Frontend Asset Bundler (Vite):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:assets
   ```

5. **Start a Background Queue Worker (Optional):**
   ```bash
   npx strux queue:work
   ```
